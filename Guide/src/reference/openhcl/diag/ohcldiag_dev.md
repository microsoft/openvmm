# ohcldiag-dev

OpenHCL includes a "diag server", which provides an interface to diagnose
and interact with the OpenHCL binary and user-mode state.

`ohcldiag-dev` is the "move-fast, break things" tool used by the core OpenHCL
dev team, and as such, it makes NO stability guarantees as to the specific
format of the CLI, output via stdout/stderr, etc...

That is to say:
**ANY AUTOMATION THAT ATTEMPTS TO USE `ohcldiag-dev` WILL EVENTUALLY BREAK!**

`ochldiag-dev` is designed to work no matter where you run OpenHCL: in a Hyper-V
VM, an OpenVMM VM using VSM or nested virtualization, or in other VMMs that
support paravisors. Consider the [`hypestv`][] tool for an interactive dev/test
tool specifically for Hyper-V VMs.

## Examples

### Check `OpenHCL` version

You can inspect a running OpenHCL VM with ohcldiag-dev.

```powershell
PS > .\ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> inspect build_info
{
   crate_name: "underhill_core",
   scm_revision: "bd7d6a98b7ca8365acdfd5fa2b10a17e62ffa766",
}
```

You can use that to validate your VM is running with the OpenHCL image you intended by checking the scm-revision output matches the commit hash of the OpenHCL repo (if building OpenHCL, you can get the commit hash of your repo using  `git log --max-count=1`).

The detailed kernel version information is available from the initial RAM filesystem only:

```powershell
PS > .\ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> run -- cat /etc/kernel-build-info.json
{
  "git_branch": "rolling-lts/underhill/5.15.90.7",
  "git_revision": "55792e0aa5e92ac4450dc10bf032caadc019fd84",
  "build_id": "74486489",
  "build_name": "5.15.90.7-hcl.1"
}
```
The OpenHCL version information can be read from the filesystem, too:
```powershell
PS > .\ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> run -- cat /etc/underhill-build-info.json
{
    "git_branch": "user/romank/kernel_build_info",
    "git_revision": "a7c4ba3ffcd8708346d33a608f25b9287ac89f8b"
}
```
### Interactive Shell

To get an interactive shell into the VM, try:

```powershell
ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> shell
```

Interactive shell is only available in debug builds of OpenHCL.

### Running a command

To run a command non-interactively:

```powershell
ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> run cat /proc/interrupts
```

### Using `inspect`

To inspect OpenHCL state (via the `Inspect` trait):

```powershell
ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> inspect -r
```

### `kmsg` log

The kernel `kmsg` log currently contains both the kernel log output and the
OpenHCL log output. You can see this output via the
[console](#kernel-console), if you have it configured, or via `ohcldiag-dev`:

```powershell
ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> kmsg
```

If you want a continuous stream of output as new messages arrive, pass the `-f`
flag:

```powershell
ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> kmsg -f
```

By default, the OpenHCL logs will only contain traces at info level and
higher. You can adjust this globally or on a module-by-module basis. And you can
set the tracing configuration at startup or dynamically with `ohcldiag-dev`.

To set the trace filter at startup, add a kernel command line option
`OPENVMM_LOG=<filter>`. To update it on a running VM, run:

```powershell
ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> inspect trace/filter -u <filter>
```

The format of `<filter>` is a series of comma-separated key-value pairs, plus an
optional default, `<default-level>,<target>=<level>,<target>=<level>`. `<level>`
can be one of:

* `trace`
* `debug`
* `info`
* `warn`
* `error`
* `off`

`<target>` specifies the event or span's target, which defaults to the fully
qualified module name (including the crate name) that contains the event, but it
can be overridden on individual trace statements.

So to enable warning traces by default, but debug level for storvsp traces, try:

```powershell
ohcldiag-dev.exe <vm name> inspect trace/filter -u warn,storvsp=debug
```

If successful, the new filter will take effect immediately, even if you have an
open `kmsg` session already.
