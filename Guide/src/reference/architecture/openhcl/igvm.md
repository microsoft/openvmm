# IGVM Artifact

The Independent Guest Virtual Machine (IGVM) format describes the initial state of an isolated virtual machine. OpenHCL is delivered as an IGVM package.

> **Note:** For more details on the IGVM specification, see the [IGVM repository](https://github.com/microsoft/igvm).

## Purpose

The IGVM file serves as the "firmware image" for the OpenHCL paravisor. It allows the host VMM to:

1. Load the OpenHCL components into VTL2 memory.
2. Place them at specific, required physical addresses.
3. Pass initial configuration data to the paravisor.

## Package Contents

An OpenHCL IGVM package bundles the following artifacts:

- **Boot Shim (`openhcl_boot`):** The entry point for VTL2 execution.
- **Linux Kernel:** The operating system kernel.
- **Sidecar Kernel (x86_64):** The lightweight kernel for APs.
- **Initial Ramdisk (initrd):** The root filesystem containing userspace binaries (`underhill_init`, `openvmm_hcl`, etc.).
- **Memory Layout:** Directives specifying where each component should be loaded in memory.
- **Configuration:** Boot-time parameters (CPU topology, device settings, etc.).

## Build Process

The IGVM artifact is generated by the OpenHCL build system.
See [Building OpenHCL](../../../dev_guide/getting_started/build_openhcl.md) for instructions on how to build it.
