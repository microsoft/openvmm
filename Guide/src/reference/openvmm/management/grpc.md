# gRPC / ttrpc

To enable a gRPC or ttrpc management interface, pass `--rpc`. This spawns an
OpenVMM process acting as an RPC server on the given Unix socket, or a Windows
named pipe:

```bash
--rpc path=<PATH>[,transport=<TRANSPORT>][,allow-sid=<SID>]
```

`transport` selects which wire protocol the server accepts:

* `auto` (default) — auto-detect ttrpc vs. gRPC per connection
* `ttrpc` — accept ttrpc clients only
* `grpc` — accept gRPC clients only

For example, to accept ttrpc clients only:

```bash
--rpc path=/path/to/openvmm.sock,transport=ttrpc
```

On Windows, a path beginning with `\\.\pipe\` selects a named-pipe endpoint:

```bash
--rpc path=\\.\pipe\openvmm
```

Use `allow-sid=<SID>` to restrict a Windows named pipe to the specified user or
group and OpenVMM's own process user. If omitted, Windows default pipe security
applies. This option is supported only for Windows named pipes.

Here is a list of supported RPCs:

```admonish note title="API reference"
The API continues to evolve, and compatibility between releases is not
guaranteed. The [`vmservice.proto`] file is the authoritative API definition.
The list below summarizes the available RPCs; some definitions may be added
before their implementation is connected end to end.
```

* CreateVM
* TeardownVM
* PauseVM
* ResumeVM
* WaitVM
* CapabilitiesVM
* PropertiesVM
* ModifyResource
* AddPcieDevice
* RemovePcieDevice
* AddVpciDevice
* RemoveVpciDevice
* Quit

`AddVpciDevice` dynamically exposes a PCI device to VTL0 over Hyper-V VPCI.
The VM must have Hyper-V enlightenments and VMBus enabled, and the host
hypervisor backend must support virtual devices. The caller supplies the
guest-visible instance ID in `AddVpciDeviceRequest.instance_id` and uses the
same ID for `RemoveVpciDevice`. The response is empty. Removing an unknown
or previously removed instance ID returns an error.

Unlike `AddPcieDevice`, VPCI does not require a root complex or a predeclared
hotplug-capable PCIe port. `AddPcieDevice` remains available when standard PCIe
hotplug semantics or a non-VPCI host backend is required.
