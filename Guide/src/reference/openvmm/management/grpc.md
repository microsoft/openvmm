# gRPC / ttrpc

To enable a gRPC or ttrpc management interface, pass `--rpc`. This spawns an
OpenVMM process acting as an RPC server on the given Unix socket:

```bash
--rpc path=/path/to/openvmm.sock[,transport=<TRANSPORT>]
```

`transport` selects which wire protocol the server accepts:

* `auto` (default) — auto-detect ttrpc vs. gRPC per connection
* `ttrpc` — accept ttrpc clients only
* `grpc` — accept gRPC clients only

For example, to accept ttrpc clients only:

```bash
--rpc path=/path/to/openvmm.sock,transport=ttrpc
```

Here is a list of supported RPCs:

The following list is not exhaustive, and may be out of date. The most up to
date reference is the [`vmservice.proto`] file.

Moreover, many APIs defined in the `.proto` file may not be fully wired up yet.

In other words: This API is _very_ WIP, and user discretion is advised.
