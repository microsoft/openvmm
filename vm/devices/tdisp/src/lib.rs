//!
//! TDISP is a standardized interface for end-to-end encryption and attestation
//! of trusted assigned devices to confidential/isolated partitions. This crate
//! implements structures and interfaces for the host and guest to prepare and
//! assign trusted devices. Examples of technologies that implement TDISP
//! include:
//! - IntelÂ® "TDX Connect"
//! - AMD SEV-TIO
//!
//! This crate is primarily used to implement the host side of the guest-to-host
//! interface for TDISP as well as the serialization of guest-to-host commands for both
//! the host and HCL.
//!
//! These structures and interfaces are used by the host virtualization stack
//! to prepare and assign trusted devices to guest partitions.
//!
//! The host is responsible for dispatching guest commands to this machinery by
//! creating a `TdispHostDeviceTargetEmulator` and calling through appropriate
//! trait methods to pass guest commands received from the guest to the emulator.
//!
//! This crate will handle incoming guest message structs and manage the state transitions
//! of the TDISP device and ensure valid transitions are made. Once a valid transition is made, the
//! `TdispHostDeviceTargetEmulator` will call back into the host through the
//! `TdispHostDeviceInterface` trait to allow the host to perform platform actions
//! such as binding the device to a guest partition or retrieving attestation reports.
//! It is the responsibility of the host to provide a `TdispHostDeviceInterface`
//! implementation that performs the necessary platform actions.
